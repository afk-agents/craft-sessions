# Craft Session #9: The Archive

Create a searchable database of your own writing with Claude.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/09-the-archive/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and bring your writing — journals, blog posts, notes, whatever you've got.
