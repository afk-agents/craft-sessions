# Craft Session #10: Mix Tape

Create a playlist with custom cover art and liner notes.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/10-mix-tape/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and tell it who the mix tape is for.
