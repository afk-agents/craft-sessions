# Craft Session #4: Field Guide

Create a pocket-sized identification guide for whatever you're into.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/04-field-guide/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and pick your subject — birds, mushrooms, coffee beans, whatever.
