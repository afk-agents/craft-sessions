# Craft Session #2: Family Recipes

Create a set of beautiful, printable recipe cards with Claude.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/02-family-recipes/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and tell it about your favorite recipes.
