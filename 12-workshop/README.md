# Craft Session #12: Workshop

Create your own custom Craft Session — design a CLAUDE.md for others to use.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/12-workshop/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and describe the craft session you want to create.
