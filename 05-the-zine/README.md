# Craft Session #5: The Zine

Create a short self-published magazine about something you care about.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/05-the-zine/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and tell it what your zine is about.
