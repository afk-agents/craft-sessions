# Craft Sessions

Guided creative projects you can build with Claude — no programming experience required.

Each session is a `CLAUDE.md` file that turns Claude into a specialized collaborator. Download one, start a conversation, and make something.

## Sessions

| # | Session | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 01 | [Card Game](01-card-game) | Design and print a custom card game |

## How It Works

1. Pick a session
2. Download its `CLAUDE.md` into a new directory
3. Open Claude in that directory
4. Follow the prompts and create something
