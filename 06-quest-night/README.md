# Craft Session #6: Quest Night

Create a complete one-shot TTRPG adventure packet — ready to run tonight.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/06-quest-night/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and describe the adventure you want to run.
