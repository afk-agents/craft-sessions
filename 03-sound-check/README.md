# Craft Session #3: Sound Check

Create an original song with album art using Claude.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/03-sound-check/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and describe the music you want to make.
