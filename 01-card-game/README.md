# Craft Session #1: Deal Me In

Create a print-and-play card game with Claude.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/01-card-game/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and describe your game idea.
