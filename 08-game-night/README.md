# Craft Session #8: Game Night 2.0

Create a board game with a board, pieces, and rules — printable and playable.

## Get Started

Download the `CLAUDE.md` file into your project directory:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afk-agents/craft-sessions/main/08-game-night/CLAUDE.md
```

Then start a conversation with Claude in that directory and describe the board game you want to make.
